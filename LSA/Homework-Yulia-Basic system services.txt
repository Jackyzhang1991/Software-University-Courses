I use arch-based linux, where the base system uses systemd/Timers to run commands or shell scripts periodically at certain times or dates.

So, I installed "cronie" for this task. Then activate it with:
$ systemctl start cronie
$ systemctl enable cronie

---------------------
The basic format for a crontab is: minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week command

So, to solve this problem, the time description for my cron job should be:

*/15 09-18 * * 1-5 ~/bin/my_system_check.sh

Where:
*/15  - Every 15 minutes
09-18 - From 09:00-18:00h
*     - Every day of month
*     - Every month
1-5   - Every weekday (Mon-Fri) (yes, it also can be writen with name)

(*) always stands for "first-last".

--------------------

But that's not all. This line should be added as a crontab via "crontab -e" command. Crontabs should never be edited directly; instead, users should use the crontab program to work with their crontabs. To be granted access to this command, user must be a member of the users group.

For a better readability and ease of usage, it's better to use crontab template:
----------
# Chronological table of program loadings                                       
# Edit with "crontab" for proper functionality, "man 5 crontab" for formatting
# User: ylin

# mm    hh     DD  MM  W    /path/progam [--option]...  ( W = weekday: 0-6 [Sun=0] )
  */15  09-18  *   *   1-5 ~/bin/my_system_check.sh
 
-----------

PS. I can check if it's working, via adding a date command to the script and redirecting the output to /tmp/script.log

Thank you for this task, it was really interesting and useful for me.
