Engine is not changed (almost, only changed getName to .name and this kind of stuff)
Required implementation is written in es6 syntax without any transpilers.
This code works with iojs (with *all* flags enabled)

**ES6 Features used:**
- let, const
- Classes (get, set, super, constructor...)
- Templated strings
- Fat arrow functions
