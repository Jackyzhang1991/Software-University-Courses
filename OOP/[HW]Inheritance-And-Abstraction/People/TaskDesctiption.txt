Problem 2.	Human, Student and Worker

Define an abstract class Human holding a first name and a last name.
•	Define a class Student derived from Human that has a field faulty number (5-10 digits / letters).
•	Define a class Worker derived from Human with fields WeekSalary and WorkHoursPerDay and method MoneyPerHour() 
	that returns the payment earned by hour by the worker. 
•	Define the proper constructors and properties for the classes in your class hierarchy.
•	Initialize a list of 10 students and sort them by faculty number in ascending order (use LINQ or OrderBy() 
	extension method). Initialize a list of 10 workers and sort them by payment per hour in descending order.
•	Merge the lists and then sort them by first name and last name.
