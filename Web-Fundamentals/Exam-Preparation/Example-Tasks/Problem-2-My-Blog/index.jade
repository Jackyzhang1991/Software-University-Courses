                h1 What is HTML 5?
                article
                    p.
                        <strong>HTML5</strong> is a core technology markup language of the Internet used for structuring
                        and presenting content for the World Wide Web. It is the fifth revision of the HTML standard
                        (created in 1990 and standardized as HTML 4 as of 1997) and, as of December 2012,
                        is a candidate recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Its core aims have been to
                        improve the language with support for the latest <strong>multimedia</strong> while keeping it
                        easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices (web browsers,
                        parsers, etc.). HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4,
                        but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
                    p.
                        Following its immediate predecessors HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1,
                        HTML5 is a response to the fact that the HTML and XHTML in common use on the World Wide Web are
                        a mixture of features introduced by various specifications,
                        along with those introduced by software products such as Web browsers,
                        those established by common practice, and the many syntax errors in existing web documents. It
                        is also an attempt to define a <strong>single markup language</strong> that can be written in
                        either HTML or XHTML syntax. It includes detailed processing models to encourage more
                        interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalises the markup available for
                        documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex
                        web applications.
                    p.
                        For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a potential candidate for <strong>cross-platform mobile
                        applications.</strong> Many features of HTML5 have been built with the consideration of being
                        able to run on low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets. In December 2011,
                        research firm Strategy Analytics forecast sales of HTML5 compatible phones would top <strong>1
                        billion</strong> in 2013.
